Awwpi 

The awwpi was created as practice for devoloping a rest-Api that is able to interact with other apis. 
The awwpi is capable of pulling top posts from the aww subreddit of reddit.com, storing them in a database, then sending the top posts to users who have
with the awwpi. The awwpi also interacts with the mailgun api in order to send emails to the userbase of awwpi. The awwpi was devoloped using flask, and the 
requirements.txt file should be referenced in order to run the api on your own machine. The awwpi is intended to be run locally, but could be altered in order to 
run on a server. There are several environment variables needed in order to run the awwpi, that can be found in the .env.example file.
